This directory contains the code for Panos's Windows interface.

I've modified it to allow it, more or less, to compile on the
present version of Poly/ML (4.0 beta1).  It needs more work to
get it to run though.  It seems to use some additional functions
in the run-time system (RTS) which aren't provided and I can't
find any source for them.  It might be possible to reconstruct them.
N.B. The RTS contains code to process window messages since that
is needed to handle DDE.  It may be that this is sufficient to
handle all the cases.
